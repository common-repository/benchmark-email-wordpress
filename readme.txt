Add a Benchmark Email signup form to your sidebar. You can also manage lists, and edit and email your blogs to subscribers.


== Description ==

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** Benchmark Email no longer supports this version of the Benchmark WordPress plugin. To download the latest version, please visit http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/benchmark-email-lite.


With a signup box, you can sign up new subscribers to your blog - on every single WordPress page.

You can use your signup box to capture important subscriber data. Ask your signups to give you info about what they want to read, how often they want emailed posts, and practically anything else you want to know.

**Manage Your Subscriptions**

When a subscriber signs up for blog updates, you can automatically add them to a new or established Benchmark Email list - right from your blog. You can also do the reverse, importing your Benchmark Email list addresses into your WordPress admin. You can create a new list, add to an older one, delete any lists on the Benchmark Email site or on your blog via the widget.

**Create, Edit and Send Blog-Post Emails**

Log into Benchmark Email and you can edit your WordPress blog posts in the Benchmark Email editor, optimizing them for an email send.

If you'd rather just email your WordPress posts to your subscribers on the fly, you can do this inside the WordPress dashboard. Send out your latest blog post in an email sent and scheduled from your Benchmark Email account.

View all the data from your WordPress email campaign - from opens to link clicks - in real time, just by logging into your Benchmark Email account.
